# typed-clojurescript-play

Playground for Typed Clojurescript.

Run `lein typed check-cljs` and change the project.clj `:check-cljs`
entry to configure which namespaces get type checked.

Intended as an easy way to help complete Typed Clojurescript.
Please report issues to [Jira](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CTYP),
catch ambrose on #typed-clojure on Freenode, or post on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-core-typed).

Don't expect too much to work initially.
